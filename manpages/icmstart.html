<h2 >NAME</h2>icmstart - A startup script for icmbuild program maintenance
<p>

<h2 >SYNOPSIS</h2>
       <strong >icmstart</strong> <em >[Options]</em> top-dir [program|library]
<p>
<h2 >DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
Although <em >icmake</em>-scripts can be written from scratch for handling program
maintenance, often the required actions are highly comparable. This
observation resulted in the construction of two <em >icmake</em>-tools:
<strong >icmstart</strong>(1), initializing a directory for program development and
<strong >icmbuild</strong>(1), handling the actual program maintenance. Both come predefined
with <em >icmake's</em> distribution, to initialize and maintain <strong >C++</strong> programs
(or, after minimal adaptation, <strong >C</strong>) programs). They can also easily be
tailored to other programming languages. The <em >icmstart</em> script and
<em >icmbuild</em> program can directly be called: <em >icmstart</em> is an <em >icmake</em>
script, for which the command-shell calls <em >icmake</em>; <em >icmbuild</em> is a small
<strong >C</strong> program that calls <em >icmake</em> to process the <em >icmbuild</em> script in
(commonly) <em >/usr/lib/icmake</em>.  
<p>
This man-page covers the <strong >icmstart</strong> script; refer to the <strong >icmbuild</strong>(1)
man-page for information about how <em >icmbuild</em> can be used.
<p>
The <strong >icmstart</strong> script is a generic script that can be used to initialize a
directory with a basic set of files that are commonly used when developing a
<strong >C++</strong> or <strong >C</strong> program. 
<p>
<strong >Icmstart</strong> creates an initial directory (here named `<em >top-dir</em>') and
installs the files <em >CLASSES, VERSION</em> and <em >icmconf</em> below <em >top-dir</em>. A
second argument `<em >program</em>' or `<em >library</em>' may be specified as the default
mode of operation of the <strong >icmbuild</strong>(1) script, usually resulting in the
addition of additional skeleton source files. If the predefined set of files
doesn't fit your needs, then the default set can easily be tailored to your
needs. The default set of skeleton files is listed in the file
<em >/etc/icmake/icmstart.rc</em>. Refer to the <strong >icmstart.rc</strong>(7) man-page for
information about how this file is structured and how it can be adapted.
<p>
After changing to the directory created by <strong >icmstart</strong> <strong >icmbuild</strong>(1)
may be used for program maintenance.
<p>
<h2 >OPTIONS</h2>
<p>
<em >Icmstart</em> supports the following options, which (when specified)
    must be <em >icmstart's</em> first arguments:
    <ul>
    <li><em >-b</em><br/>
       Basic installation: the files VERSION, usage.cc and version.cc are not
        installed, and the #define USE_VERSION entry in icmconf is commented
        out.
    <li><em >-c confpath</em><br/> Use the configuration files (<em >icmstart.rc, AUTHOR,
        YEARS</em> and <em >VERSION</em>) if found in `confpath' rather than in
        <em >~/.icmake</em> and/or <em >/etc/icmake/</em>. Once a file is found it is used
        allowing partial overrides of the default files provided by
        <strong >icmake</strong>(1).
    <li><em >-d</em><br/>
       Do not execute any commands, but show the commands that would have been
        executed on the standard output.
    <li><em >-I</em><br/>
       Do not install files. 
    <li><em >-r</em> 
       Unconditionally replace existing files. If <em >-r</em> is not provided
        <strong >icmstart</strong> will ask the user to confirm that an existing file must
        be overwritten. If a skeleton specification refers to a directory, the
        full directory and its subdirectories will be replaced.
    <li><em >-s skeleton-path</em> <br/> 
       By default skeleton files are listed in the skeleton resource file
        <em >/usr/share/icmake/icmstart.rc</em>. Alternatively, the skeleton
        resource file may be specified by the <em >ICM</em> environment variable,
        which -in turn- may be overruled by the path specified with the <em >-s</em>
        option. The skeleton path may be specified as a full file-path or as a
        directory, in which case the skeleton resource file is assumed to be
        <em >icmstart.rc</em> (see below at <strong >SKELETON FILES</strong>).
    </ul>
    Since <strong >icmstart</strong> uses <em >cp</em> to install files, <em >cp</em> must be
available when <strong >icmstart</strong> should install skeleton files.
<p>
<h2 >SKELETON FILES</h2>
<p>
Skeleton resource files may contain comment (empty lines and lines beginning
with the hash-mark (<em >#</em>)) which is ignored, and should otherwise contain
specifications of resource <strong >s</strong> to install.
<p>
The default resource specification file is <em >/etc/icmake/icmstart.rc</em>,
containing:
        <pre>

    CLASSES
    icmconf
    P main.cc 
    P main.ih 
    P usage.cc
    P version.cc
    P ? scanner 
    P ? parser  
        
</pre>

    This file is overruled by <em >~/.icmake/icmstart.rc</em>. The <em >~/.icmake</em>
directory (called `configuration directory' below) can be prepared using the
following system command:
        <pre>

    cp -r /etc/icmake ~/.icmake
        
</pre>

    This directory can be provided with skeleton files. Default skeleton files
are commonly found in <em >/usr/share/icmake</em>, and could be copied to the
configuration directory and referred to by the configuration directory's file
<em >icmstart.rc</em>.  See <strong >icmstart.rc</strong>(7) for details about how skeleton files
can be referred to <em >icmstart.rc</em>.
<p>
<h2 >CONFIGURATION FILES</h2>
<p>
The configuration directory's files <em >icmstart.rc, AUTHOR, YEARS</em> and
<em >VERSION</em> are recognized as skeleton files and are, if available, processed
by <em >icmstart</em>.
<p>
If the <em >-c</em> option was specified configuration files found in the path
specified at this option are used. If not specified or if a file isn't
found then the path <em >~/icmake</em> is inspected. If a configuration file isn't
found in <em >~/icmake</em> either, configuration files in <em >/etc/icmake</em> are used.
<p>
Configuration files are optional; if absent  <em >icmstart</em> can still be used,
but in normal cases at least <em >icmstart.rc</em> is provided.
<p>
In addition to <em >icstart.rc</em> consider defining the files <em >AUTHOR, VERSION,</em>
and <em >YEARS</em> in the configuration directory:
    <ul>
    <li> If the file <em >AUTHOR</em> exists it should have one line, defining the
author of the program. E.g.,
        <pre>

    #define AUTHOR "Frank B. Brokken &lt;f.b.brokken@rug.nl&gt;"
        
</pre>

    If it does not exist <em >icmstart</em> uses the default <em >#define AUTHOR ""</em>. 
<p>
<li> If the file <em >VERSION</em> exists it should have one line, defining the
program's version. E.g.,
        <pre>

    #define VERSION "1.00.00"
        
</pre>

    If it does not exist <em >icmstart</em> uses the default 
    <em >#define VERSION "0.00.00"</em>.
<p>
<li> If the file <em >YEARS</em> exists it should have one line, defining the
program's initial release year or range of release years. E.g.,
        <pre>

    #define YEARS "2016"
        
</pre>

    or a range of years can be defined:
        <pre>

    #define YEARS "1992-2016"
        
</pre>

    If it does not exist <em >icmstart</em> uses the default 
    <em >#define YEARS "yyyy"</em> where <em >yyyy</em> is the current year.
    </ul>
<p>
The <em >AUTHOR, VERSION,</em> and <em >YEARS</em> definitions are concatenated to one
file, called <em >VERSION</em>, which is installed in the top-level directory.
<p>
If the file <em >icmstart.rc</em> does not exist (or is empty) <em >icmstart</em>
merely installs the top-level directory, <em >icmconf</em> and <em >VERSION</em>.
<p>
<h2 >FILES</h2>
    The mentioned paths are sugestive only and may be installation dependent:
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >/usr/share/icmake/icmconf</strong>
        Example of a <strong >icmbuild</strong> configuration file;
    <li> <strong >/usr/share/icmake/CLASSES</strong>
        Example of a <strong >icmbuild</strong> <em >CLASSES</em> file.
    <li> <strong >/etc/icmake/icmstart.rc</strong>
        Default skeleton resource file.
    </ul>

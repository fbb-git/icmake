icmake (9.01.00)

* Man-pages weren't properly updated at 9.00.00. This was fixed in this
release. 

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 03 Sep 2016 15:10:43 +0200

icmake (9.00.00)

* Added support program icm-dep computing dependencies for USE_ALL classes and
  precompiled headers, called from /usr/bin/icmbuild, or directly using
  icmake's option --icm-dep (-d)

 * Icmake supports several long options in addition to the standard short
   options. See icmake(1) for details.

* Changed references to IS_* into O_* in icmake(1)'s man-page. The IS_ entries
  were already unavailable, but the man-page still referred to them. Now
  fixed. 

 * Contents of lines in CLASSES beyond the first word are no longer
   interpreted.

 * Added new option NO_PRECOMP_WARNING to icmconf

 * Option -b was removed from icmake.

 * The built-in function makelist(mask, [younger,older], referencefile) is now
   operational (was mentioned in icmake's man-page, but wasn't implemented
   before).

 * Repaired a bug in substr that could segfault.

 * Man-pages updated. Icmbuild(1) contains a description of the icm-dep
   program. 

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 23 Jul 2016 20:55:33 +0200

icmake (8.01.00)

* Added builtin functions 'strchr', 'listfind', and 'listunion'. See 'man
   icmake' for details.

* Fixed a bug in icmake's option handling due to which options could not be 
  forwarded to called scripts.

* Fixed a bug in the compilation of ternary expressions: the condition wasn't
  explicitly converted to bool, causing constructions like 'ret = fun() ? ...'
  to fail.

* The 'icmstart' script was modified, improving control over which files
  should initially be installed (see 'man icmstart' and 'man icmstart.rc' for
  details. 

* Icmake's predefined function stat(P_NOCHECK, entry) returns, if `entry'
  does not exist, a list having two elements: list[0] == 0, list[1] == -1.

* The builtin function 'getch()' now prints one newline character when the
  user presses 'Enter' (previously 2 newlines were printed).

* The main() function must have return type 'void' (this was already required
  in earlier versions, but is now enforced).

* When defining executable icmake scripts using 
        #!/usr/bin/icmake -t
  -t. indicates that the temporary .bim file must be defined in icmake's
  temporary directory, using icmake's pid and the .bim suffix as its filename.

* When PARSER-related specifications are not used, they can all be removed
  from 'icmconf' files.

* When SCANNER-related specifications are not used, they can all be removed
  from 'icmconf' files.

* Support for using 'grambuild' (superfluous since 2008) was removed from
  'icmbuild' 

* Updated the manpages and examples (examples now use -t. 
    rather than -qt /tmp/...)

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 13 Feb 2016 13:40:10 +0100

icmake (8.00.05)

 * Fixed typo in the icmconf manpage: 
        #define PRECOMP           "-x c++-headers" 
   must be
        #define PRECOMP           "-x c++-header"

 * Fixed a bug in the implementation of the '#undef IDENTIFIER' preprocessor
   directive causing intermittend errors on amd64 architectures: instead of
   removing the entry from the table of defined identifiers the id of the 
   item to undefine is simply changed into an empty string. A bit of a kludge,
   but it solves the problem.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 21 Dec 2015 14:12:03 +0100

icmake (8.00.04)

 * Fixed handling of line continuation backslashes (\$) in icm-pp

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 11 Dec 2015 22:01:51 +0100

icmake (8.00.03)

 * Fixed an erroneously placed variable definition in icmbuild.in

 * Fixed too late assignment of a function's address into its symtab record
   due to which functions could not recursively be called.


icmake (8.00.02)

  * Fixed a leftover size_t / unsigned mismatch on amd64 architectures.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 08 Dec 2015 19:23:40 +0100

icmake (8.00.01)

  * Fixed size_t / unsigned mismatches on amd64 architectures.

  * Applied patches provided by Tony Mancill. Thanks, Tony :-)

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 08 Dec 2015 10:55:36 +0100

icmake (8.00.00)

  * This release adds several new builtin functions, which required a
    redefinition of the builtin function codes. Because of this existing .bim
    files must be recompiled from their .im source files. 

  * Martin Dorwig suggested several additions to icmake's run-time support
    functions. In particular facilities for formatted string construction and
    formatted printf functions. Many of his suggestions were implemented in
    version 8.00.00, which now offers several new built-in functions
    (get_dext, length, resize, strformat, trim, trimleft, trimright (see
    icmake(1) for details)).

  * The functions fprintf and printf now support a format string as their
    first argument, in which %-notations refer to subsequent argument numbers
    (see icmake(1) for details). 

  * The 16 bit offset limit was removed from fgets. Also, fgets's signature
    changed. See icmake(1) for details.

  * Added the 'continue' statement/keyword to the flow constrol statements. It
    can be used inside while and for statements.

  * Added the ternary operator (?:) to the set of supported operators. 

  * Global variable initialization can now use expression statements, not just
    constant expressions.

  * Local variables can be defined and immediately initialized anywhere inside
    functions. Multiple local variables (of the same type) can be defined in
    the initialization section of a for-statement, A single variable can be
    defined in the condition clause of if- and while-statements. If not
    explicitly initialized such variables represent a `false' condition.

  * Character constants are supported and are converted to single-character
    string constants. Conversely, single-character string constants can be
    used in int-expressions. In that case their values are equal to the
    int-values of their (first) characters.

  * The main() functions in icmake scripts now by default return 0.

  * Fixed a bug in the printf family of functions: these functions now return
    the number of printed arguments (as documented in icmake(1)'s man-page).

  * Fixed a bug in handling decrement and increment operators: previously
    their resulting wasn't pushed on the stack when used in return statements,
    causing a stack underflow.

  * Fixed a bug in the icm-pp precompiler: multiple #defines of the same
    identifier are not accepted anymore. Multple #undefines are OK, but
    an #undefine generates a warning if it doesn't refer to a currently 
    #defined identifier. 

  * Drive specifiers are not supported anymore

  * The function glob() is now assumed available.

  * The internal code organization in the rss, icm-pp, icm-comp, and icm-exec
    directories was significantly changed. Code belonging together is now
    collected in its own subdirectory, where the subdir-name is used as
    first part of the name of `public' functions (but their source names do
    not start with the subdir name. E.g. symtab_push is found in
    symtab/push.c). Support functions inside a directories start with an
    abbreviated subdir-name, both in their names and in their source filenames
    (e.g., st_addVar is found in symtab/staddvar.c). Also, within
    subdirectories 'dirname.ih' files contain all declarations that are
    required only by the sources in that directory, while 'dirname.h' files
    contain all declarations required by other parts of icmake programs that
    use the subdirectory's `public' functions. Because of this reorganization
    several old files (like rss/ic*h files) became obsolete and were removed.

 *  The -q and -b options are not supported anymore.

 *  The -e option replaces the previously defined -b option.

 *  The -v option shows icmake's version to the standard output stream
    (terminating icmake).

 *  The -F flag shows which files, and flags are used by icmake, and which 
    actions are going to be performed.

 *  The -T flag can be used to specify a non-default destination directory for
    temporary files (by default /tmp or (if not available) $HOME is used).

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 29 Nov 2015 18:35:22 +0100

icmake (7.23.02)

  * Wow! After > 20 years being used, Martin Dorwig found a bug in icm_pp's
    getident() function: it didn't accept digits in identifiers. It's fixed in
    this release, now implementing the standard definition of an identifier.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 16 Oct 2015 14:46:41 +0200

icmake (7.23.01)

  * Overlooked checking for PRECOMP in icmbuild's precompile() function.
    Now fixed.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 15 Oct 2015 16:45:39 +0200

icmake (7.23.00)

  * Updated CXXFLAGS in generated icmconf files to contain --std=c++14

  * Added the define
        //#define PRECOMP "-x c++-header"
    to icmconf files. When activated, internal header files are precompiled 
    when they are more recent than their precompiled versions.

  * Added the define
        #define IH ".ih"
    to icmconf files, specifying the extension of internal header files. It is
    used by PRECOMP. 

  * Reorganized the #defines in the icmconf mold file so that related #defines
    are easily recognized.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 15 Oct 2015 14:52:21 +0200

icmake (7.22.01)

  * The `ar' program in binutils >= 2.25.7 generates a warning when the u
    modifier is used in combination with the r option. Icmake's icmbuild
    script previously used 'ar cru'. To prevent the warning, 'ar cr' is now
    used.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 16 May 2015 20:35:40 +0200

icmake (7.22.00)

  * `icmstart dir library' uncomments the library construction spec. and
    comments out the main.cc spec. in icmconf

  * `icmstart -b ...' (basic installation), won't install the default
    VERSION, usage.cc and version.cc files

  * `icmstart -b ...' and `icmstart ... library comments out the line
     #define USE_LIBRARY in icmconf.

  * The default g++ compiler flags now specify c++14

  * Added the file 'required' summarizing the software which was used for
    building icmake.

  * The entry //#define EXTENSION   ".exe" was removed from INSTALL.im as it's
    apparently no longer required for systems like cygwin. In cases the .exe
    extension is needed, rename the binaries accordingly after building them.

  * Removed -D__STDC_VERSION__=199901L from the flex call in ./comp/build

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 20 Jan 2015 15:53:40 +0100

icmake (7.21.01)

  * By default, ./icm_bootstrap no longer specifies -g when compiling icmake's
    sources. If you *want* to use the -g flag, define an environment variable
    CFLAGS. E.g., CFLAGS="-Wall -O2 -g".

  * Applied Colin Herbert's patches (to see Colin's patches use the prefix
    https://gist.github.com/ColinHebert/): 

    Removed the redundant definition of __STDC_VERSION__ from lexer.c:
        1377507/raw/545a60cb39105c80d97e543dc77e00ab7ecbb5ff/lexer.c.diff

    Removed the hard coded path to CONFDIR:
        1377533/raw/c7cb3f768deafa8c2e393bed1f5d4acd42edc7bd/icm_install.diff

  * The above changes were suggested by Florian Franzen. Thanks!

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 20 Jan 2014 11:00:27 +0100
        
icmake (7.21.00)

  * Repaired segfaults found in icmake, icm-exec, and icmun by Alexandre
    Reber.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 30 Jul 2013 16:49:58 +0200
    
icmake (7.20.00)

  * added missing '\n' to the strtok call in icmbuild's 'dependenciesOf'
    function

  * line continuation in CLASSES results in one line being counted in the
    icmbuild script.

  * Added suggestions by Johann 'Myrkraverk' Oskarsson about compiling icmake
    on solaris (in ./contributions/solaris)

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 09 Mar 2013 14:48:45 +0100

icmake (7.19.00)

  * build scripts for constructing icmake now support the CC environment
    flags as well. CC defines the C-compiler to use.

  * icmbuild script's COMPILER and COMPILER_OPTIONS variables should be
    considered obsolete, and are overruled by 
        CXX and CXXFLAGS, defining the C++ compiler and flags
    or
        CC and CFLAGS, defining the C compiler and flags
    in that order.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 16 Jul 2012 15:39:52 +0200

icmake (7.18.00)

  * Fine-tuned icmbuild so that only used USE_ALL files are removed instead of
    all files named so

  * The initial program files installed by default by icmstart assume that the
    flexc++ scanner generator (0.93.00) and the bisonc++ parser generator (>=
    3.00.00) is available.

  * The documentation about class dependency handling was improved

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 22 Feb 2012 14:06:48 +0100

icmake (7.17.00)

  * Changed (mproved/repaired) the directory dependencies handling (as defined
    in CLASSES) by icmbuild.in; improved the readability of icmbuild's output.

  * Updated YEAR(S) information in VERSION and ./usr/share/icmake/version.cc
    to 2012.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 03 Jan 2012 17:39:28 +0100

icmake (7.16.01)

  * Removed erroneous -o from '-fPIC -o' in icmbuild at line 450 in
    icmbuild.in 

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 28 Sep 2011 20:41:33 +0200

icmake (7.16.00)

  * `icm_bootstrap' script now recognizes CFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment
    variables for, resp. gcc and ld flags. 

  * icmbuild script now correctly interprets class dependencies defined in
    CLASSES and correctly interprets USE_ALL (see `man icmconf') 

  * `icmbuild' script now recognizes (configurable) CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS for,
    resp. g++ and ld flags. Default values are defined in the program's
    'icmconf' file.

  * By default the COMPILER setting now includes --std=c++0x and -Wall, 
    preventing accidental omission by CXXFLAGS. 

  * The default file name suggested for USE_ALL is 'a' (e.g., class/a)

  * Documentation was updated (in particular the `icmconf' man-page)

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 24 Jun 2011 20:29:38 +0200

icmake (7.15.00)

  * AUTHOR, VERSION and YEAR removed from /etc/icmake, see icmstart(1)

  * Double installation of changelog.gz prevented

  * /usr/share/doc/icmake/mail.frank removed from the installation

  * icmstart.rc supports optional P and L flags for program and library
    only icmake project installations. See icmstart.rc(7)

  * Using standard x.yy.zz version number format

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 14 Feb 2011 20:56:28 +0100

icmake (7.14.1)

  * Added test for defined SHAREDREQ to icmbuild

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 17 Jan 2011 20:29:51 +0100

icmake (7.14.0)

  * Repaired segfault error caused by calling an underfined function
    (comp/callfun.c) 

  * Removed compiler warning about dangerous casts from comp/outcode.c and 
    comp/patchup.c by defining a union for char[2] and int16_t, rather than
    casting the char[2] to int16_t.

  * Defined icm_prepare, called from icm_bootstrap and rss/build to prepare
    the tmp/ directory

  * The separate 'build' icmake scripts were still expecting librss.a. Changed
    to the proper library name: libicrss.a

  * Modified the shared library construction function to use the linker flag
    --as-needed, repaired the 'defs' flag spelling (was: def), added the
    icmconf entry SHAREDREQ to contain the names and paths of libraries
    required by the shared library, and the shared library construction is now
    using COMPILER (rather than gcc) to construct the shared library with.

  * added the `ALL' facility to icmbuild, allowing the specification of a
    class dependency graph in the CLASSES file. 

  * Added the icmconf(7) man page

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 14 Jan 2011 13:19:59 +0100

icmake (7.13.1)

 * Manpages in release 7.13.0 were not refreshed. Now repaired.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 03 Oct 2010 14:42:48 +0200

icmake (7.13.0)

 * the icmconf file has a (default not active) #define REFRESH that may be
   activated when a binary program is created. When active a new binary is
   always created even if no source was compiled. This may be useful when 
   the program uses a library that is actively under development and is
   frequently changed.

 * the icmbuild script offers the option -c doing a 'tput clear' (clear
   screen) just before starting the build process. The icmconf #define CLS, by
   default not active, accomplishes the same.

 * /etc/icmake/VERSION contains 2010

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 02 Oct 2010 15:52:09 +0200

icmake (7.12.5)

 * added missing test for modified SCANSPEC (lexer) file in
    scripts/icmbuild.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 23 Dec 2009 10:44:30 +0100

icmake (7.12.4)

  * repaired lacking directory recognition in scripts/icmstart.im
  * removed `return 0;' from usr/share/icmake/main.cc as 0 is returned by
    default 
  * replaced endl by `\n' in usr/share/icmake/usage.cc
  * changed the location of the main repository in make/about.c

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 22 Dec 2009 14:53:53 +0100

icmake (7.12.3)

  * applied the patch given in Debian bug report #537574

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 29 Jul 2009 13:22:13 +0200

icmake (7.12.2)

  * icmbuild  touches 'version.cc' only if it exists.

  * The built-in function 'gets()' will now remove a trailing \n as per the
    icmake man-page

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 17 Jul 2009 13:20:33 +0200

icmake (7.12.1)

  * icm-pp supports the #undef directive

  * updated icmake's release year to 1992-2009.

  * library construction contains code to create a shared library as a
    new option that can be specified in icmconf

  * the top-level directory has been reorganized. See INSTALL and QUICKINSTALL
    for details. Icmake's initial construction uses `icm_bootstrap' and
    prepares an icmake installation under ./tmp/

  * installation of (parts of) icmake constructed by `icm_bootstrap' is done
    using `icm_install'.

  * added `where-is-what' giving an overview of what the various top-level
    files and directories are for.

 * configuration files for icmstart are found in the following locations (in
   order, accepting the first file(s) found:
        (1) determined by -c 
        (2) in $HOME/.icmake 
        (3) found in /etc/default/icmake. 

  * the previously used `def/destinations' file is not used anymore.

  * the file `icmconf' has been modified (see icmbuild(1)), allowing, e.g.,
    multiple lexical scanner specification files.

  * documentation adapted.

  * new man-page: icmstart.rc(7).

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 14 Apr 2009 13:00:51 +0200

icmake (7.11.1)

  * Introduced a three-digit version number: major, minor and subreleases.

  * Updated icmbuild sources to 2008.

  * The Gnu g++ flags for the upcoming c++0x standard are now mentioned in
    icmconf. 

icmake (7.11)

  * Fixed missing dead[0] initialization in comp/icm-comp.c

    Fixed handling of C and C++ comment in strings in icm-pp: The preprocessor
    now keeps C/C++ comment in string/character constants in #defines allowing
    for constructions like #define PAT "dir/*" which in earlier versions
    resulted in an unterminated C comment error.

    The icmstart and icmbuild scripts are now bisonc++ >= 2.0.0 aware, and
    grambuild is now effectively superfluous (but still available)

    Added #define EXTENSION to def/destinations to allow easy compilation in
    cygwin environments

    The script icmscripts.sh can be used to recreate the icm-scripts in the
    bin/ subdirectory. Primarily useful for maintenance.

    The 'unix' script no longer by default constructs stripped versions of the
    binary programs, the install.sh by default installs unstripped
    binaries. The argument 'strip' may be provided to strip the binaries.

icmake (7.10)

  * Removed Superfluous #defines from icm.h

    #define values may extend over multiple lines, using the \ character as
    the last character on the line to indicate line-continuation. 
    
    Applied size_t where applicable, using unsigned otherwise to prevent
    problematic behavior on some 64 bit architectures. 

    Changed many old-style classic C parameter lists into ANSI C style
    parameter lists 

    Minor textual repairs to the manual pages.

    Added the option to compile with extensive compiler flags in the top-level
    build script.

    MSDOS is no longer suported by specific code. 

icmake (7.02)

  * Repaired a misconfiguration in the bootstrap.sh and install.sh scripts due
    to which the icmstart and icmbuild scripts weren't properly installed.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 21 Feb 2007 14:49:23 +0100

icmake (7.01)

  * The INSTALL file was updated. So were the scripts bootstrap (now named
    bootstrap.sh) and unix. Compilation warnings appearing on Mac OS-X were as
    good as possible removed, some old files and directories 
    were removed or placed in a directory of their own.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 07 Feb 2007 15:50:33 +0100

icmake (7.00)

  * The subdirectory examples is renamed to templates

        [Above change: Mon, 05 Feb 2007 16:09:46 +0100]

    Defines (#define) may use other #defined variables to determine their
    value. 

    icmake's sources may use hexadecimal constants (0xdead)

    global and local variables may be immediately initialized by constants
    and/or available functions. Variables cannot be used for the
    initialization. 

    execute() function repaired: it never succeeded due to invalid return
    value

    initial source may or may not have .im extension, as suggested in the 
    general usage info provided by icmake itself. If the specified initial
    source does not exist, an .im extension is attempted.

    The IM environment variable may contain several, `:'-delimited paths

    getenv() implemented: returns list: [0]: ok (or not), [1]: value of the
    environment variable

    strlen/strupr/strlwr now defined as rss-functions, no longer as macros

    strstr renamed to strfind. 

    substr() added, returning a substring from an existing string.

    (f)printf() now have int-return values (instead of undefined)

    icmake manual page rewritten

    added icmbuild script for general program maintenance
    added icmbuild manual page

    added icmstart script to start an icmake maintenance project using
    icmbuild 
    added icmstart manual page

    the `unix' script will regenerate the parser and the lexical scanner if
    their specification files have changed.

        [Above changes: Tue, 21 Sep 2006 14:31:43 +0200]

    icmcomp uses a resizing rather than a fixed sized buffer to store strings
    found in an icmake script (used to be a fixed-sized buffer of 100 chars,
    causing icmcomp to segfault with, e.g., long option lists)

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 18 Nov 2006 10:34:13 +0100

    The type `unsigned' was changed to `size_t' where appropriate
    Fixed some flaws in the `unix' script, and (??) added icm-exec.c to
    my local icmake svn repository

    Added icmstart script to start an icmake project in some subdir
    
    Global strings weren't initialized to empty strings. Now they are.

icmake (6.30)
    
    Debian patches up to 6.22-7 processed; more in general: the sources now
    compile free of warnings

    chdir("") now returns initial working directory

    Execution error on the powerpc repaired. Caused by strcmp() sometimes
    returning a non-zero value having its lowest 16 bits equal to zero. Since 
    icmake internally uses 16-bits int values, this results in a zero value
    following an int to int16 assignment. See, e.g.,  exec/string/compare.c

    During the process of repairing the above error, Icm-exec was completely
    rewritten. 

    Lintian warning about an error in the icmake.1 manual page repaired
    Lindian warning about the inappropriate executable mode of 
    examples/defines.im repaired.

    Newer versions of icmake programs operate fine on existing (older) binary
    scripts as long as icmake's major version isn't upgraded. Newer versions
    of binary icmake files remain to be inexecutable with older icmake
    versions. 
    
    PRE-ANNOUNCING VERSION 7.00:

    A major upgrade (to version 7.00) will be released soon. As a prelude: it
    will define new built-in functions: getenv() and substr() will be
    completely new, and strstr() will be replaced by the new function
    strfind(). Existing scripts defining getenv(), substr() and/or strfind()
    should rename these functions to, e.g., my_getenv() (and comparable) or
    (possibly) remove these definitions and use the new built-in functions.

    The distiction between distribution version and program version (see
    below) is removed. All programs will have the same version as the
    distribution. 

NOTE:   The version referred to here is the version of the distribution,
        not of the icmake programs.

6.22    Compiler warnings and the use of gets() removed from the sources
        All programs now use the same version, which is defined in 
        version.c, which is defined in the rss.
        Standard manpage (icmake.1) included in the distribution.
    
6.21    Elf binaries for unix

6.20    Unix-icmake accepts the -t flag, to specify a temporary binary-
        icmake file. Allowing in unix-environments the riddance of the
        permanent bim-file. The temporary binary makefile will --in this
        case-- get the process-id for its extension.

6.18 - 6.19: Not distributed.

6.17b   DOS-distribution only: Dependencies on icce.h and sicce.lib
    removed from the distribution. Programs are *not* affected by
    this distribution.
    
6.17    Comment accepted in #define directives,
        Trailing info on #include lines ignored,
    Minor changes to documentation files.

6.17    This is as far as our memory reaches: the log of changes before
        this distribution are lost to future generations...
        This release never made sunsite or tsx-11. Only ftp.icce.rug.nl
    got it, and two sub-releases beyond.

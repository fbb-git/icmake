INSTALLING ICMAKE
=================

                            Version 6.22

        ----------------------------------------------------------
                        NOTE for UNIX platforms:
                    ========================
        
        We do our best to catch ^M's in the source files. However,
    sometimes they slip through the net. If a file contains ^M
    characters the compiler may choke. If so, please remove the
    ^M's and recompile.
        ----------------------------------------------------------
    

        The installation files for Icmake come as an archive, e.g.,
"icmake.zip" or "icmake-6.20.tgz". These archives unpack to several
directories and files.

Please note that, starting with distribution icmake-6.17.tgz, the archive
unpacks to directories icmake/xxx below the current directory. So, if you
unpack icmake-6.17.tgz (or later versions) in the directory
/usr/local/src/icmake, a directory /usr/local/src/icmake/icmake is created,
and other subdirectories below /usr/local/src/icmake/icmake.

        To unpack the archives, create an appropriate directory (e.g.,
"/usr/local/src/icmake" for Unix platforms, or "c:\c\icmake" for DOS) and
change-dir to that directory. Use an appropriate archiver to unpack. Some
possibilities are described below:

(a) Archives in the form ".tgz" can be unpacked using
        "gzip -c -d icmake-6.17.tgz | tar xvf -".
If you have GNU tar version 1.11.2 or higher, you can use
        "tar xvzf icmake-6.17.tgz".

(b) The archives with the extension ".zip" can be unpacked using
"unzip icmake.zip" or "pkunzip -d icmake.zip".

        The extraction of files from the archive should yield a lot of C
source files in a number of directories. The default distribution of Icmake
does not contain makefiles for the Unix-utility "make" anymore.

For Linux-unix platforms, the icmake-executables are found in the subdirectory
binlinux. For Ms-DOS platforms, the icmake-executables are found in the
subdirectory bindos. Depending on what platform you use, install either, both,
or none of these executables.

For other UNIX-platforms the programs can be created by compiling all files "by
hand". Even here, we made it easy for you to bootstrap icmake, by providing the
shellscript bootstrap. Simply say

                           'sh bootstrap'

and the full icmake compilation is performed. This will put the executables in
the bin subdirectory below the icmake subdirectory created by the untarring of
icmake-X.YY.tgz. Also, it will leave a lot of compiler residues behind, such
as .o files. However, after 'sh bootstrap' the unix-script can be used (see
below, you have to put the icmake files in /usr/local/bin or adapt the
'unix' script and 'def/destinations.im' to suit your system). After putting
the icmake programs in their proper directories, say

                            'unix clean'
                
to clean up the garbage.                

Finally, you can do it all by yourself. Then compile all files as indicated
in the following steps:

(a) Note that even though grammar definition and lexical scanner definition
    files (parser and lexer) are found at several subdirectories, the bison and
    flex programs should *NOT* be used. The parser.c and lexer.c files are
    already available, and you might run into name-resolution problems if you
    try to create parser.c or lexer.c with the bison/flex found at your site.
    The parser and lexer files were included for documentation purposes only,
    don't feed them to bison or flex.

(b) With some files the (GNU-C) compiler generates warnings. These warnings
    fall into two categories: 'default' entry proints in switches cause the
    compiler to complain about undefined enumeration values inside the switch,
    and these warnings can safely be ignored.

    Then, with the lexer.c and parser.c files the compiler may complain about
    variables which were defined but not used. Again: no harm done, and you can
    safely ignore these warnings as well.

(c) Change-dir to the directory "rss". This directory contains sourcefiles for
    the Runtime Support System. These functions are used in all the programs of
    the Icmake family.

    Compile all files, using the appropriate compiler flags which cause your
    compiler to compile-only.
    If your compiler supports memory models, choose the "small" model.
    E.g., these compiler flags are:

    for GNU's gcc:                  gcc -c -DHAVE_GLOB
    for Microsoft C 7.00:           cl -c -AS


    NOTE:
    =====
    This note is only relevant for the compilation of icmake under MS-DOS,
    and can be ignored in all other cases.
    
    Below the ICMAKE\RSS subdirectory the subdirectory ASM is found. In this
    directory the files REDIRECT.ASM and REDIRECT.OBJ are stored.

    The REDIRECT.OBJ file is included in the ICRSS.LIB library by the DOS-MSC
    icmake-script, and is not removed thereafter.

    The file REDIRECT.ASM is included for reference purposes only.
    REDIRECT.ASM could be assembled 'by hand' using the ML-assembler, using
    the following commands:

        set ml=-c -Cp -DMM='S'
        ml redirect.asm

    The file icmake\rss\asm\redirect.obj must be added to the icrss.lib
    library in icmake\rss. E.g., in the directory icmake\rss the following
    command could be given:

        lib icrss -+asm\redirect ;
    
    NOTE:
    =====
    The flag -DHAVE_GLOB causes the function glob() to be included in the
    code, which expands a filename with wildcards to a list of names. The flag
    is not needed for MSDOS compilations. If you do not have this function,
    leave out the -DHAVE_GLOB specification. This is further discussed below.

    While compiling, you may need other special definition flags to produce
    workable code for other systems. Please check the section below to see
    if you need any special flags.

    Next, place the produced object files into one library. A suggested name is
    "libicrss.a" for Unix systems, or "icrss.lib" for DOS systems. See the
    documentation of your library manager ("ar" or "lib") for the required
    command line.

    For Unix systems try:
                              ar rsv libicrss.a *.o
    in the directory "rss".


(d) The following directories were also created from the archive:
            make,
            pp,
            comp,
            exec,
            un.

    The directories hold respectively the files needed for the top-level
    program "icmake", for the preprocessor "icm-pp", for the compiler
    "icm-comp", for the executor "icm-exec" and for the unassembler "icmun".
    These program names are on Unix-based systems without extension; supply
    ".exe" for DOS.

    Change-dir to each of these directories, and compile and link all .c files
    into the appropriate program. E.g., for a Unix system you might type:
            cd make
            gcc -DHAVE_GLOB -o icmake *.c ../rss/libicrss.a
            cd ../pp
            gcc -DHAVE_GLOB -o icm-pp *.c ../rss/libicrss.a
            cd ../comp
            gcc -DHAVE_GLOB -o icm-comp *.c ../rss/libicrss.a
            cd ../exec
            gcc -DHAVE_GLOB -o icm-exec *.c ../rss/libicrss.a
            cd ../un
            gcc -DHAVE_GLOB -o icmun *.c ../rss/libicrss.a
            cd ..

    For a DOS platform with the Microsoft compiler, you might type:

            cd make
            cl -AS -J -Feicmake.exe *.c ..\rss\icrss.lib
            cd ..\pp
            cl -AS -J -Feicm-pp.exe *.c ..\rss\icrss.lib
            cd ..\comp
            cl -AS -J -Feicm-comp.exe *.c ..\rss\icrss.lib
            cd ..\exec
            cl -AS -J -Feicm-exec.exe *.c ..\rss\icrss.lib
            cd ..\un
            cl -AS -J -Feicmun.exe *.c ..\rss\icrss.lib
            cd ..

    Whichever platform you use, please name the resulting program by the
    appropriate name (one of "icmake", "icm-pp", "icm-comp", "icm-exec",
    "icmun", optionally followed by an extension ".exe" for DOS systems). The
    reason for this is the fact that the top-level program "icmake" must be
    able to call all subsequent programs, of which the names therefore must be
    known. Furthermore, you may need special compilation flags for rare systems
    (see the section below).

(e) If all goes well, you've now created all necessary programs. Move the
    executable files to a system directory; e.g., "/usr/local/bin" for Unix
    systems, "c:\sys\bin" for DOS systems, etc.

(f) For all subsequent releases of Icmake which you may wish to install, you
    can use your old programs of the Icmake family and the included
    icmake-files. E.g., the installation includes a file "unix" to create
    Icmake for Unix platforms.

    Prior to using the unix script, you may wish to
    edit the following files:

        def/programs:           to (re)define and check the programs used
                                by the unix-script,
        def/destinations:       to (re)define your system directory, etc.

    Even when you successfully create Icmake by hand, it may be a good
    idea to re-make it with the makefile to check its workings. Just type
    "unix", or "icmake dos-msc" or whatever is appropriate; then follow
    the instructions which are printed by the makefile.

Special flags while compiling
-----------------------------

        This section is also found in INSTALL.

        A large part of the source code of Icmake should compile on any
platform. The exceptions we have encountered so far are the following:

(a) On MSDOS platforms, the constant MSDOS must be defined. This symbol is
by default defined by the Microsoft compiler. For other compilers on DOS
systems, a flag "-DMSDOS" may be necessary when invoking the compilations.
Non-DOS systems should, obviously, *not* have a defined symbol MSDOS.

(b) Many systems which are based on GNU software, such as the Linux
operating system, have a function glob() to expand wildcards to filenames.
Icmake should be compiled with the symbol HAVE_GLOB (flag -DHAVE_GLOB on the
compiler command line) when this function is available.

When Icmake is compiled without this flag, wildcards are expanded using a
`poor mans solution' (PMS). See the file rss/dosfind.c for further details.

Modifying Icmake: the preloaded symbols
---------------------------------------

        Icmake does not require special modifications. However, you may wish to
take a look at the file pp/loadsym.c. In this file the function 'loadsym()'
of the preprocessor icm-pp is found. The preloaded symbols of Icmake are 
defined in this function. E.g., MSDOS is defined as 1 when an MSDOS platform 
is used, linux is defined as 1 when Icmake is compiled for Linux, etc.. 
If you plan to use these predefined symbols in your Icmake scripts, make sure 
that the conditional code in the file pp/loadsym.c recognizes your platform.

        If you are unsure whether this code recognizes your compiler, build
Icmake as distributed and try out the sample icmake file examples/defines.im
(i.e., say: "icmake examples/defines"). If the output of the makefile is
not satisfatory, modify pp/loadsym.c. E.g., if your MegaC compiler defines the
symbol MEGA_C, you might want to add the following lines to pp/loadsym.c:

                        #ifdef MEGA_C
                            preload("MEGA_C", "1");
                        #else
                            preload("MEGA_C", "0");
                        #endif

Currently the following symbols are built in Icmake:

        --------------------------------------------------------------
        symbol          1 when defined on the platform ... otherwise 0
        --------------------------------------------------------------
        MSDOS           MS-DOS platform (with MSC 7.00 compiler)
        unix            Unix, usually with GNU's gcc compiler
        linux           '386 or '486 running Linux (usually with gcc)
        M_SYSV, M_UNIX  '386 or '486 running SCO/Unix (usually with
                        Microsoft C)
        _POSIX_SOURCE   Unix with Posix complient compiler
        __hpux          HP-UX, with the native HP compiler
        --------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to modify something here which hasn't been done before, please
email us about it, and we'll include it in the standard distribution.
